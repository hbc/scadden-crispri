This project is to look at comparing pre vs post-transplantion in two cell
lines with two different versions of the Gecko library (A and B). The goal is
to look for genes depleted across both versions of the Gecko library and both
cell lines.

We were given tables of counts and the FASTQ files. For a first analysis
we'll just use the table of counts.
